# Sum To Zero

Given the list of integers L = [a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>]

Write an O(n^2) to return the unique triplets (a<sub>i</sub>, a<sub>j</sub>, a<sub>k</sub>)
where i, j, and k are distinct indices, and a<sub>i</sub> + a<sub>j</sub> + a<sub>k</sub> = 0.

You may assume that the resultant set of triplets does not include any duplicates.

### Constraints

- All Built-in sorting functions, dictionaries, and hash maps are prohibited.
- 3 <= n <= 3000
- -10<sup>6</sup> <= a<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>6</sup>, for all 1 <= i <= n
